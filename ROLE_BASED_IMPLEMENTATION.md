# Role-Based Access Control Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the complete implementation of differential role-based access control for the Hostel Management System's Admin Panel. The system implements three distinct roles with specific workflows and permissions, with recent enhancements for flexible assignment management and streamlined workflows.

## Architecture

### 1. Database Schema

#### Core Tables
- **`user_roles`**: Defines the three roles with JSON-based permissions
- **`app_users`**: Extended with role assignments and specializations
- **`cost_approvals`**: Manages the cost estimation and approval workflow
- **`floor_incharge_authentications`**: Tracks floor incharge verification activities
- **`complaint_assignments`**: Manages complaint assignments to campus coordinators with reassignment capabilities
- **`work_progress_updates`**: Tracks work execution progress
- **`complaint_activities`**: Comprehensive activity logging
- **`temp_user_passwords`**: Temporary password storage for demo accounts

#### Enhanced Workflow Stages
The system implements a streamlined workflow with admin flexibility:
1. `VERIFICATION_PENDING` - Initial complaint submission
2. `VERIFIED` - Floor incharge verification completed
3. `PENDING_ADMIN_ASSIGNMENT` - Awaiting admin assignment decision
4. `ASSIGNED_TO_CAMPUS_IC` - Assigned to campus coordinator
5. `COST_ESTIMATION_PENDING` - Cost estimation in progress
6. `PROPOSAL_SUBMITTED` - Cost estimate submitted for approval
7. `PROPOSAL_APPROVED` - Cost approved, work authorized
8. `WORK_IN_PROGRESS` - Work execution in progress
9. `WORK_DONE` - Work completed by campus coordinator
10. `WORK_VERIFICATION_PENDING` - Awaiting floor incharge work verification
11. `WORK_VERIFIED` - Work quality verified
12. `RESOLVED` - Final resolution by admin
13. `CLOSED` - Complaint closed

### 2. Authentication System
