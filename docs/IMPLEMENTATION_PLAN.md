## 📱 Mobile-First Design Principles

### **Responsive Breakpoints**
```css
/* Mobile tablets (768px and below) - Primary focus */
mobile: '768px'
/* Desktop (769px and above) - Secondary */
desktop: '769px'
```

### **Touch-Friendly Design**
- Minimum touch target: 44px x 44px
- Generous spacing between interactive elements
- Large, clear typography (minimum 16px)
- Swipe gestures for navigation
- Pull-to-refresh functionality

### **Performance Optimization**
- Lazy loading for images
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Optimized bundle size
- Progressive image loading
- Efficient caching strategies
