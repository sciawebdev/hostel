# Role-Based Access Control Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the complete implementation of differential role-based access control for the Hostel Management System's Admin Panel. The system implements three distinct roles with specific workflows and permissions.

## Architecture

### 1. Database Schema (`database/role_based_schema.sql`)

#### Core Tables
- **`user_roles`**: Defines the three roles with JSON-based permissions
- **`users`**: Extended with role assignments and specializations
- **`cost_approvals`**: Manages the cost estimation and approval workflow
- **`warden_authentications`**: Tracks warden verification activities
- **`complaint_assignments`**: Manages complaint assignments to campus in-charge
- **`work_progress_updates`**: Tracks work execution progress
- **`complaint_activities`**: Comprehensive activity logging

#### Workflow Stages
The system implements a 10-stage workflow:
1. `COMPLAINT_SUBMITTED`
2. `WARDEN_VERIFICATION`
3. `ASSIGNED_TO_CAMPUS_IC`
4. `COST_ESTIMATION`
5. `COST_APPROVAL`
6. `WORK_IN_PROGRESS`
7. `WORK_COMPLETED`
8. `WARDEN_WORK_VERIFICATION`
9. `FINAL_APPROVAL`
10. `RESOLVED`

### 2. Authentication System

#### Components
- **`AuthProvider.tsx`**: Context provider for authentication state
- **`useAuth.ts`**: Authentication hooks and user management
- **`LoginForm.tsx`**: Role-based login interface with demo accounts

#### Demo Accounts
- **Administrator**: `admin@hostel.edu` / `admin123`
- **Campus In-Charge**: `campus@hostel.edu` / `campus123`
- **Hostel Warden**: `warden@hostel.edu` / `warden123`

### 3. Role-Specific Dashboards

#### Administrator Dashboard (`AdminRoleDashboard.tsx`)
**Capabilities:**
- View all system statistics and analytics
- Approve/reject cost estimates
- Assign complaints to campus in-charge
- Resolve complaints after work completion
- Access comprehensive reporting

**Key Features:**
- System-wide overview with resolution rates
- Cost approval management
- Final resolution authority
- Complaint assignment workflow

#### Campus In-Charge Dashboard (`CampusInChargeDashboard.tsx`)
**Capabilities:**
- View assigned complaints
- Provide detailed cost estimates
- Update work progress with photos/notes
- Submit final bills and completion reports
- Cannot resolve complaints (admin-only)

**Key Features:**
- Specialization-based assignment filtering
- Cost estimation with detailed breakdown
- Work progress tracking with percentage completion
- Bill submission workflow

#### Hostel Warden Dashboard (`HostelWardenDashboard.tsx`)
**Capabilities:**
- Authenticate complaint validity
- Verify work completion quality
- Provide opinions for final decisions
- Cannot change complaint status directly

**Key Features:**
- Complaint verification workflow
- Work completion verification
- Evidence-based authentication
- Opinion-only influence on decisions

### 4. Workflow Management

#### Hooks (`useRoleBasedWorkflow.ts`)
- **Cost Approvals**: Create, approve, reject cost estimates
- **Warden Authentication**: Verify complaints and work completion
- **Complaint Assignments**: Assign work to appropriate specialists
- **Work Progress**: Track and update work completion status
- **Final Resolution**: Admin-only complaint closure

#### Components
- **`CostApprovalsList.tsx`**: Cost approval management interface
- **`AdminComplaintManagement.tsx`**: Full admin complaint workflow
- **`CampusInChargeComplaintManagement.tsx`**: Campus IC work interface
- **`WardenComplaintManagement.tsx`**: Warden verification interface

### 5. Main Application Integration

#### App Structure
```typescript
<QueryClientProvider>
  <AuthProvider>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/admin" element={<RoleBasedDashboard />} />
        // Other routes...
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  </AuthProvider>
</QueryClientProvider>
```

#### Role-Based Routing (`RoleBasedDashboard.tsx`)
Automatically routes authenticated users to appropriate dashboards based on their role.

## User Experience

### Design Principles
- **Blue backgrounds with white/black text** for optimal contrast and readability
- **Professional color scheme** with role-specific visual indicators
- **Responsive design** for various screen sizes
- **Intuitive navigation** with clear role-specific workflows

### Workflow Example

1. **Student submits complaint** → `COMPLAINT_SUBMITTED`
2. **Warden verifies authenticity** → `WARDEN_VERIFICATION` → `VERIFIED`
3. **Admin assigns to Campus IC** → `ASSIGNED_TO_CAMPUS_IC`
4. **Campus IC provides cost estimate** → `COST_ESTIMATION`
5. **Admin approves cost** → `COST_APPROVAL` → `APPROVED`
6. **Campus IC executes work** → `WORK_IN_PROGRESS` (with progress updates)
7. **Campus IC marks complete** → `WORK_COMPLETED`
8. **Warden verifies completion** → `WARDEN_WORK_VERIFICATION` → `VERIFIED`
9. **Admin final approval** → `FINAL_APPROVAL`
10. **Admin resolves complaint** → `RESOLVED`

## Security Features

### Role-Based Permissions
- **Permission checking** at component and API levels
- **Route protection** based on user roles
- **Action restrictions** based on current workflow stage
- **Data filtering** by role and assignment scope

### Data Integrity
- **Workflow stage validation** prevents invalid state transitions
- **Assignment tracking** ensures proper work allocation
- **Activity logging** for complete audit trail
- **Cost approval workflow** prevents unauthorized expenditure

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **TanStack Query** for state management
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **Sonner** for notifications

### Backend Integration
- **Supabase** for database and authentication
- **Real-time subscriptions** for live updates
- **Row Level Security** for data protection

## Testing

### Demo Flow
1. Navigate to `/admin`
2. Login with any demo account
3. Experience role-specific dashboard
4. Test workflow actions based on role permissions
5. Observe real-time updates and proper access controls

### Key Test Cases
- **Role switching**: Login as different roles to see different interfaces
- **Permission validation**: Verify actions are restricted based on role
- **Workflow progression**: Test complete complaint lifecycle
- **Data isolation**: Ensure users only see appropriate data

## Installation & Setup

1. **Database Setup**:
   ```sql
   -- Run the role_based_schema.sql file
   \i database/role_based_schema.sql
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

3. **Start Development**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access Admin Panel**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/admin`
   - Use demo credentials to test different roles

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Mobile application** for field staff
- **Advanced analytics** with charts and trends
- **Automated notifications** via email/SMS
- **Document management** for work orders and bills
- **Integration with inventory** management systems
- **Multi-language support** for diverse user base

### Scalability Considerations
- **Microservices architecture** for large-scale deployment
- **Caching strategies** for improved performance
- **Load balancing** for high-availability
- **Database optimization** for complex queries
